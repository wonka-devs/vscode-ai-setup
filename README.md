# VSCode AI Setup

## The Problem

Many beginner developers waste time:
- Copying errors to external AI tools
- Receiving generic answers
- Testing random VSCode extensions
- Repeating the same debugging cycle

This setup reduces friction and integrates AI directly into your workflow.

---

## What This Includes

- Curated VSCode extensions
- Optimized settings.json
- AI prompt pack for debugging and refactoring
- Practical workflow guide

---

## Who This Is For

- Programming students
- Beginner developers
- Devs who want faster debugging

---

## Goal

Less friction.  
More velocity.  
Better code.

## CodeBoost Method

A practical 5-step workflow to solve coding problems using AI more effectively:

1. Define your environment (language, framework, version).
2. Provide full error context, not just the message.
3. Ask for diagnosis before asking for solution.
4. Request step-by-step reasoning.
5. Refine and iterate until the issue is fully resolved.

This reduces random trial-and-error and improves debugging speed.
